# Go Programming Language Introduction

## Performance and Memory Management

**Compiled to Native Machine Code**

- Go compiles directly to native machine code (binary), resulting in fast execution performance

**Efficient Memory Management**

- Efficient memory usage with intelligent garbage collection
- Garbage collection runs concurrently with the program without blocking execution
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: An automatic memory management system that identifies and frees up memory that your program is no longer using
- Go intelligently decides memory allocation:
  - **Stack**: Fast allocation with automatic cleanup
  - **Heap**: Slower allocation that requires garbage collection

## Popular Go Frameworks and Libraries

### Web Frameworks

- **Gin**: Lightweight, fast HTTP web framework with comprehensive middleware support

### Microservices/gRPC

- **Go-kit**: Comprehensive toolkit for building microservices
- Go excels at creating microservices architectures

### Database/ORM

- **GORM**: Feature-rich Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database operations
